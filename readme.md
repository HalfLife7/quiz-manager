# Background

Have you ever felt bored while studying for tests and doing practice quizzes? Maybe you would rather be playing a game instead of studying for your next test. Although studying will never be as fun as playing a game, adding elements of games to your quizzes through gamification may provide that extra bit of motivation to get that A+.

Wikipedia describes the gamification of learning as _an educational approach to motivate students to learn by using video game design and game elements in learning environments. The goal is to maximize enjoyment and engagement through capturing the interest of learners and inspiring them to continue learning._

By creating a quizzing platform with gamification elements, I hope to combat some of the boredom that comes from studying with gamification elements such as achievements and competition through leaderboards. Additionally, adding a social/communal element such as Forums where users can help each other out may help make studying seem like less of a chore.
